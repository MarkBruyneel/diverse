Diverse Projects

The scripts that I post here are diverse in nature and involve specific tests or projects that are unrelated to bigger projects.

The first script here is about searching PDF files for 1 or more keywords and making lists of these.
It works fine for simple PDF files generated from Word documents that were converted to PDF documents or PDF files created from Webpages.
PDF documents from publishers can not be searched so easily as they have a great variety of information in them that does not easily allow for searchjing through them using the tool.
